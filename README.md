# CFBRiskPy
Repo containing ItalianReptar's python tooling for CFBRisk.

## How To Run the Script
Currently, because I am lazy and don't want to module this all out (yet), I simply run the `cfb_plots.py` file as a script.
What this means is, if you have python and the necessary modules (see `requirements.txt`), then one should be able to simply do the following:

#. Change the "day" to be whichever roll # you want to generate plots for. I iterate this manually. (Note that sundays are not a roll, so a Saturday roll may be roll 36, and that makes the Monday roll 37.)

#. Run the file:

In windows:
```
py cfb_plots.py
```

In linux:
```
python cfb_plots.py
```

#. All the plots should auto-save into the cfb_artifacts directory under the current date in ISO format.


## Generating the `cumsum_dsig_data_X.csv`

If you don't have the prior day's csv data, the entire CSV can be regenerated by finding the `start` variable in `main()` and setting it to 0 so it can re-poll the api and generate the plots to make the delta sigma values.

## TODOS

#. Make the repo only have to poll the API for a given day if the data doesn't exist yet, and save the data after polling.

#. Make the repo more module-like and not just a script so others can use the tools available.
